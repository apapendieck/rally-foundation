The most <br>important impacts on youth development included, creating a sense of normalcy and <br>structure, providing safe spaces for self-expression, and exposure to new skills and <br>concepts. These influences on youth resulted in discovery of new talents, increased self-<br>confidence, and an enhanced sense of social responsibility. The programs encouraged <br>healthy development in an environment that is challenging these normal processes. The <br>positive influences on youth extended to their families, and even to the neighborhoods <br>and communities in which they live. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:750px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">with fundamental deficiencies in social services and basic standards of living. The <br>evaluation participants identified issues they are struggling with in their communities <br>including, a lack of assistance programs for basic needs and services, or an inability to <br>access them if they do exist; weakened social support networks; mental health counseling <br>and emotional support; and a lack of recreational opportunities for youth.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:936px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">of the programs, this evaluation offers several recommendations for future youth <br>programming in post-disaster environments. Community centers, youth drop-in centers, <br>community-based mentorship programs, and school-based mental health support and case <br>management are specific interventions discussed in the evaluation. General elements of <br>any youth program should include normalcy and structure, individualized attention, <br>inclusion of family, cultivation of trust, and fulfillment of basic needs. </span></nobr></DIV>

The interruption of services for daycare, education, and cultural <br>enrichment threatened to compound the emotional and practical struggles already <br>experienced by these groups. These struggles included displacement; financial burdens; <br>and considerable grieving over loss of community, personal belongings, and even loved <br>ones.</span></nobr></DIV>

Surveys, interviews, and document review revealed <br>uncertainty regarding the extent to which schools and non-profit organizations, whose <br>capacities had been significantly reduced by the damage, would be able to fulfill the <br>needs of youth and communities.  Service providers were grappling with issues such as <br>structural damage to facilities, reductions in staff, and funding cuts. These needs <br>identified by the assessment required thoughtful programming, as well as significant <br>funds and resources to ensure that the youngest survivors of Katrina received the care, <br>support, and stability essential in a post-disaster environment.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">broader neighborhood communities. While all programs were unique, common themes <br>and experiences emerged from conversations with the beneficiaries. The following <br>discussion describes how the grants helped rebuild healthy communities, renew<br>capacities of service-providing organizations, support parents and families, and <br>encourage positive youth development.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Rebuilding Healthy Communities</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:274px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">One of the most important ways that the GCYPRF affected communities was by</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:294px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">re-establishing services and activities that had existed before the hurricane. The staff <br>members implementing the youth programs brought a commitment to rebuilding back <br>into the neighborhoods and helped to establish normalcy where for so long disorder had <br>dominated. In discussing community impact, one service provider commented, “I think <br>people just saw life. People saw a little bit of normalcy amidst all the chaos that was <br>going on...I think it would have been comforting to some of the folks to see that going <br>on.” This sense of normalcy contributes to a future orientation; a hope that things will <br>continue to improve, especially when children are involved. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:460px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">In addition to reassuring communities of progress, these programs solidly filled </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:481px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">some glaring gaps in services. The return of services addressed the communities’ <br>concrete needs, including case management, child care, mental health support, young <br>adult education, and physical fitness. By addressing these needs with programs that <br>occupy children, parents were available to contribute to community recovery by working <br>on damaged homes and returning to jobs. Many parents, such as the plumber and <br>electrician who had their children in grant-funded daycares and camps would have been <br>otherwise unable to work. Without these valuable services in the community, recovery <br>would have been slower and much more frustrating than it already was. Creating assets<br>that fill important needs is a key element of community building, especially for <br>communities that have lost most of their services and infrastructure.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:688px;left:194px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The programs established new networks, collaborations, and relationships with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:708px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">other community groups and organizations, such as Rotary, Kiwanis, and local schools, <br>making it easier and more efficient to provide services. These connections and <br>reconnections helped to develop a community network for donations, sharing of <br>information and resources, and providing referrals. In addition to network creation among <br>community organizations, parents also benefited from supportive networks. In one <br>program, some parents decided to form a monthly support group for hurricane-related <br>issues. This relationship-building is a sustainable outcome of the programming in that it <br>paves the way for future collaborations.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">One important element of the programming, specifically for the arts-oriented </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:895px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">programs, was the incorporation of local traditions in culturally-specific activities. Mardi <br>Gras beading and quilt-making were unique ways to honor local culture and instill <br>community pride. One dance instructor included elements of New Orleans and St. <br>Bernard parish traditions in her activities and conversations with the youth. Parents also <br>recognized the need to remind their children where they come from. As one parent said, <br>“Nurture our culture. You know, what is New Orleans?...Teach them about, this is your <br>home, this is why your mom is proud to be a New Orleanian; why your grandmother was </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">proud to live here.” Exploring and celebrating local culture with the youth participants is <br>a way to help them recognize and commemorate their community strengths.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:150px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">A valuable attribute of the programs that impacted the broader community was </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:170px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">the promotion of a culture of giving and social responsibility. Some programs recruited <br>volunteers from local schools providing an opportunity to do service in the community. <br>Other programs taught skills, such as basic literacy, that facilitated becoming a “...viable <br>part of a community, as opposed to being someone who just requires a constant <br>entitlement,” as one instructor framed it. Within the programs formed small communities <br>of support amongst the youth and the staff members. One teaching artist was impressed <br>by the transformation of the youth participants:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:336px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">...to watch the camp become a community in itself; just a regular working <br>community, like family. You went in there during lunchtime, you had <br>some of the older kids in the kitchen helping, serving, checking on the <br>younger kids to see if they were OK. That was just really special to see <br>that. To see everybody working together, as one unit, was very special.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:460px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Parents also recognized these transformations and the long-term impact they could have <br>on community, and even society. As one parent said:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:522px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Programs like this, I think they offer a view of what could be better....It <br>teaches the kids how to work together, how to come to positive conflict <br>resolution, how to handle things a lot better than the people that came <br>before them. And I think the benefit is really going to take hold in the <br>future, future generations. They're going to be able to teach us a thing.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Renewing Capacity of Organizations</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:708px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The grants provided not only resources and funding to the recipients, but also </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:729px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">provided stability to programs that often operate on a grant-by-grant basis. The post-<br>Katrina climate of uncertainty threatened organizations’ ability to maintain services, and <br>in some cases even threatened their survival. One agency, discovering that their office <br>had escaped catastrophic damage, paused to regroup: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:833px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">And we weren't sure where funding was going to come from this year. We <br>never know, because that's what we live on...We were re-evaluating <br>everything in the middle of September. And still, we knew that half of <br>New Orleans was gone so that means maybe half of our funding was <br>gone...So it was important for us to have this grant because we just didn't <br>know. We didn't know our future at that point.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:978px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">When the grants were awarded, these organizations had the ability to move forward and <br>resume serving their communities as needs increased exponentially.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1019px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">In addition to resuming services with the funds received from the GCYPRF, the </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">funding sources. One agency director stated that the grant, “...made a huge impact on the <br>fact that the other grants that we’re writing are going to be very successful because of the <br>fact that we were successful with Mercy Corps.” This mechanism contributes to <br>consistency of services because it allows the organizations to maintain their presence in a <br>community; this fosters trust and relationship building.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:212px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The grants helped to establish structure and normalcy, not only for the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">communities they served, but also for the staff members of the recipient organizations. <br>These individuals were also struggling with post-hurricane loss, including jobs, income, <br>and even a reason to get out of bed. One daycare director said running the daycare was, <br>“...the best thing I could have done because I sat everyday in my little parking lot in my <br>itty bitty trailer, looking at total destruction. And I'm about children and childcare, so <br>being able to get back into a normal situation was very good mentally.” Other staff <br>members said support services made available to them by the grants helped them to cope, <br>and actually made a positive difference in overall job performance. The grants made it <br>possible for staff members to reclaim their helping roles, ultimately enhancing the <br>capacity of these organizations.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:460px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Support for Parents and Families</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:501px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The role the granted programs played in the lives of parents and families is hugely </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:522px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">significant. The programs provided temporary relief when it was most needed, alleviating<br>their anxiety and stress over what to do with their children. Services were so limited, and<br>even non-existent in some areas, that parents had few options for childcare. In many <br>cases children could not be left at home due to hazardous conditions, even if a baby-sitter<br>happened to be available and affordable. In practical terms, the programs provided a safe <br>place for children. As one parent stated: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">I couldn't even leave my children at home with a home sitter because the <br>yard was torn up, debris everywhere...You know, we had four feet of <br>water in our house. It floated off its piers, so it had to be demolished. So <br>even though we had FEMA trailers there, the house was still there falling <br>over onto our FEMA trailer. I mean, is that a place for kids to be?...And <br>you need peace of mind to go to work. You don't need to be worried...</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:812px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">On a deeper level, the stress relief may have been even more valuable. Peace of mind was <br>in short supply. An early childhood mental health care provider believes, “Some of the <br>families are just on the edge. They’re just teetering on the edge.” One parent validated <br>this by describing the difficulties of having children at home when dealing with so many <br>other issues: “Because having to be at home, and having to deal with insurance, FEMA, <br>this, that; plus add on top of that three little children under the age of four, stress level is <br>through the roof.” She went on to explain how getting her child into a program alleviated <br>some of that stress for her.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">of an agency providing emotional support to families dealing with serious health issues <br>described the impact she felt her agency had on their client families: “I think that it is <br>helping them to lift the hearts and the souls and the minds of some of these families. Like <br>they know there's somebody there if there's an emergency. There's somebody there who <br>cares.” A parent receiving mental health support described the impact of having these <br>services available to her: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:253px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">...because literally, I feel on the verge of a nervous break down. You <br>know, there's no closure to anything...trying to move forward with your <br>life but you can't...It was nice to be able to talk to someone and get their <br>perspective on you know, what I can actually do to better the situation as it <br>currently is...There's a lot of people who are still hurting and having to <br>deal with this on a daily basis. This has been absolutely devastating.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:398px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Programs have also provided referrals for assistance with WIC, food stamps, housing, <br>and legal advocacy to client families.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:439px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Some of these family support services helped to equip guardians with techniques </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:460px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">and coping mechanisms for addressing issues with their children and other family <br>members. One counselor stated that in working with the parents, “...once you teach them <br>the tools and they implement it at home, they feel empowered...And not only giving them <br>tools to work on parenting issues, but also, how to calm down, how to relax, which I find <br>is helpful for them.” A parent described issues of fear her child is struggling with and <br>how mental health services have helped them cope:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:605px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">...if he sees the sun, if it starts to cloud up, and the sun goes behind the <br>clouds, he starts getting anxious. ‘I don't want the rain to come Momma...’<br>Because he's still dealing with that. He still mentions several things about <br>the storm, and so our counselor has been teaching him how he can better <br>cope. And teaching me coping skills to help him be a little less fearful and <br>whatnot.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:750px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">One student described how she taught her mother breathing exercises she had been using <br>in a school program, and how they used these together to help them through difficult <br>situations, specifically in dealing with other family members. Not only did this provide a <br>tool, but it also empowered the student to teach a loved one something healthy she had <br>learned from her program. Others commented that higher patience levels stemming from <br>stress management decreased mistreatment in families.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:850px;left:531px"><nobr><span class="ft7">4</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:853px;left:537px"><nobr><span class="ft0"> This aspect of programming is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">sustainable in that long after the services are gone, individuals still have the capacity to <br>draw on these tools and strengths for difficult situations in the future.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:915px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Once parents had someplace safe and stimulating for their children to be, they </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:936px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">were able to attend to pressing needs weighing on them; in most cases returning to a job <br>or working on a damaged home. Adults were left to handle adult problems without the </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1011px;left:140px"><nobr><span class="ft9"> One mental health counselor even stated, “I think it's going to reduce ultimately, the cases of abuse. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1029px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft10">Because we have seen, after Katrina and last school year, huge amounts where we've had to report abuse <br>cases, and kids coming to school with marks, and a lot of issues like that. It's gone down, so I think we have <br>more families that we're able to kind of lower the stress for and take it and normalize it, and make it OK.”</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">children having to be involved. As one mother explained, “And the one year old already <br>knows how to put the phone to his ear, so that kind of makes me feel guilty...Poor kid, <br>that’s all he sees his mom doing is being on the phone.” Not only is it more difficult for <br>parents to handle issues when they have children at home, but their stress is detrimental <br>to the emotional health of their children. A parent discussed how having her child in a <br>head start program meant that she did not have to worry as much about the effects of <br>Katrina on her child, because she was in school.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:253px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Another important aspect of parents being freed to resume employment was the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:274px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">return of income. Most parents would not have been able to work without some type of<br>programming for their child. One parent discussed the realities of unemployment post-<br>Katrina:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:357px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">And then the whole life would suffer for the whole family. Because you <br>can't pay bills. And the bills still came in. Oh, that next month, you still <br>had bills to pay. You know, you didn't have the money, didn't have the <br>job, but you had the bills.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:460px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">For these reasons, the ability to return to work and start generating income was <br>instrumental for parents. The programs were essential in allowing families to survive in <br>an uncertain and thoroughly damaged environment, while also providing caring and <br>stimulating activities for youth.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:543px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">An additional financial impact of the youth programming for families was that it </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:564px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">helped maintain affordability and accessibility of services. At a time when so many other <br>goods and services were becoming more expensive and difficult to obtain, the youth <br>programs met families’ needs. Costs of summer programs were described as prohibitive <br>for some parents, but the purpose of the funded programs was to reduce barriers to youth <br>participation. In one case, the funding helped a daycare owner keep her prices at the same <br>level as before the storm. Because this was the only operating daycare center in the entire <br>parish, this pricing was a huge relief to parents. Another center was able to provide free <br>daycare on a temporary basis until families were able to regain some income and other <br>daycares reopened. Arts camps provided free or low-cost programs with high quality <br>services and unique learning opportunities for the children. A teaching artist for one of <br>these camps commented on the community reaction to the low costs by saying, “I don’t <br>think people could really fathom that it was just $25.00. That was just too good to be <br>true.” In addition to providing free services, a young adult education program further <br>reduced barriers by supplementing transportation and childcare for some of its students. <br>This helped them to more consistently attend their literacy and GED preparation classes. <br>Many of the funded programs targeted low-income households and populations in need. <br>Their inclusiveness was hugely beneficial to families struggling with lack of information, <br>lack of resources, and mounting financial burdens.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:998px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The funded programs positively contributed to youth development in numerous </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1019px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">ways. The theme of returning to normal routines and activities was discussed with respect <br>to communities and families, but developmentally, establishing normalcy is much more </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">crucial for children. For example, one parent and daycare owner discussed how important <br>basic consumer services like fast food restaurants and grocery stores were to her children: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:170px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">We need a McDonalds...My kids want to go to McDonald's at least once, <br>twice a week. I mean, you're laughing, but it's a sense of normalcy for <br>them...The kids couldn't even wait to go to their first day at Winn Dixie<br>(grocery store) because they used to go with their parents before the <br>storm...because it all has to do with something for their normalcy and <br>getting back into what they did before the hurricane.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:315px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Another parent expressed concern for one of her younger children:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:357px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">...my one year old, as far as mental health, I don't think that there's any <br>concern there, but developmentally, there's been some issues. Because <br>we're not on a schedule, we're not on a routine. The child hasn't even been <br>able to sleep in a crib or in his own room.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:460px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Another daycare provider expressed a similar concern: “these children needed...a routine, <br>some place to go, other kids to be around...A place to feel safe. I've still got one right now <br>that if she hears a loud noise, she starts screaming. She thinks a hurricane is coming.”<br>These children, including infants, are experiencing intense emotions and adjustments<br>even fourteen months after the hurricane has passed.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:564px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The programs addressed these issues by providing a place for the children to go </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:584px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">every day, and by establishing a consistent and constructive tone. By setting guidelines <br>and fostering an environment of mutual respect, those working with the youth established <br>safe, healthy, and nurturing environments. These environments gradually encouraged <br>attitude shifts and positive behaviors in youth participants. In commenting on one <br>organization’s consistent approach to work with children, a teaching artist noted:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:708px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">We were the same way every day; we had the same rules every day. We <br>didn’t bend; we didn't make exceptions. These are the rules and you have <br>to follow them. It was summer and we wanted them to have fun, but at the <br>same time, there has to be some kind of structure there...And accepting <br>responsibility. And they really got that. They took ownership of the camp, <br>and they wanted their camp to be better.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:853px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The counselors and instructors used different tools and strategies for setting these </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">tones, including poster boards with rules written out; handbooks discussing issues such as <br>listening, focus, trust, and respect; and in one case, a daily unity circle at the start and end <br>of each camp day. One teaching artist,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:957px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">...saw similar things that you would see whenever you have the adults <br>setting a certain kind of a tone. They (the children) just seemed to really <br>appreciate it. You know, birthdays, special days, we would sing for them. <br>They were kind of standoffish in the beginning and warmed up toward the <br>end.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:129px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Some implementers described fewer “explosions in behavior,” moving “from <br>rambunctious to more calm and polite,” and a specific child who, “as opposed to leading <br>the folks who were causing the disruption, he was leading the folks who were trying to <br>get it done.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:212px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The youth also recognized these behavior changes in themselves. One student in </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">an education program said that in order to participate, “I had to stop hanging around with <br>a lot of people. I had to stop wanting to fight so much...So I just had to just change my <br>whole attitude.” Other youth discussed the calming effects of some of the programs, <br>including anger management, stress relief, relaxation, and increased patience. The youth <br>seemed to appreciate these opportunities to focus on positive activities. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:336px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The normalcy established by the programs allowed children to be children; to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:357px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">engage in youth activities; to play. While this benefit sounds simple, the current <br>environment of stress and loss in which youth are living elevates its importance. As one <br>daycare provider stated, “...after the hurricane, they were all coming back to nothing. All <br>the kids were coming back to no toys; they were all coming back to no house.” In <br>speaking with some of the youth participants, field trips were a highlight often <br>mentioned. Going to the zoo, the pool, the bowling alley, or the IMAX were needed <br>treats. Some groups had to travel significant distances out of their damaged communities <br>to get to these places, but that made it even more meaningful. An arts instructor discussed <br>her approach to reducing adult worries and concerns for the children:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:564px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">I just continued to do things that they liked and that they enjoyed post- and <br>pre-Katrina...Just so they could feel like, they didn't have to think about <br>that they have to go home to their trailer, or their house wasn't there. So <br>we just talked more of the lighter subject.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">For children, normalcy is playing with other children, engaging in fun activities, and <br>interacting with caring adults focused completely on their needs. The funded programs <br>provided this.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:729px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">They also provided an alternative to unhealthy environments and activities, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:750px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">increasing youth safety. One parent appreciated how a summer camp kept his son <br>occupied: “You know, kids like to hang out and sometimes, you know, idle minds, idle <br>hands, it's not a good thing. It's the devil's playground.” Many people pointed out that a <br>lack of recreational opportunities for youth leads them to devise their own forms of <br>entertainment, including unproductive and destructive ones. Some youth recognized this <br>as well. One student said, “I've got to be busy doing something. And I'd rather be busy <br>doing something positive than negative.” In diverse forms, these programs provided <br>positive outlets. One program exposed youth to a healthier lifestyle through yoga. Others <br>helped with anger management, stress reduction, and concrete services such as GED <br>preparation. They all increased youth health and safety in some capacity.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:957px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Another impact of the programs was the creation of emotionally safe </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:978px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">environments for expression, especially as it related to the hurricane. Activities and <br>discussions helped to normalize youth’s experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Some of the <br>programs were tailored specifically to mental health needs. A mental health counselor <br>described the progress she had made with a student at an early childhood center:</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:129px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">I have one little client...really traumatic...they left their home due to the <br>high flooding and had to stay under the overpass for a few days. And <br>exposure to violence, looting, grandfather is out there with a shotgun...But <br>just amazing how I started the session where she wasn't saying anything, <br>to now she's just opening up to develop that rapport. And just seeing her <br>express herself, express her feelings, and communicating them is just...I <br>had a great session today.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:294px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Other programs provided children with emotional support just by recognizing that need <br>for expression, honoring it, and incorporating it into activities:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:357px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Leaving like the discussion open for the kids to voice all their concerns <br>and everything through their art. Everything would go back to Katrina. <br>Somehow it goes back to Katrina. So we were definitely like...art teachers, <br>but we were acting as mental health professionals in a certain way. Just <br>because of the nature of being so close to the storm.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:481px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">The specific approaches to providing this emotional support for the children was less <br>important than the manner in which these adults accomplished it. They established <br>trusting relationships with the children that fostered honesty, openness, and <br>communication. In doing so, they strengthened their resiliency. As one teaching artist <br>said, “...we wanted to...turn something that is a negative into a positive, so that they could <br>kind of come back and...take back some power.” This helped the youth to integrate the <br>hurricane into their experiences and regain a sense of control. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:626px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The individualized positive attention that the youth received from program staff</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:646px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">was very valuable. Though most of the programs centered around group activities, the <br>teachers, counselors and instructors placed extra emphasis on one-on-one interactions. <br>One teacher noted,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:729px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">I don't think a lot of these kids get recognized for anything positive. So we <br>kind of went out of our way, when we saw them doing something good, to <br>acknowledge it. To let them know that good attention matters too. They <br>get enough negative attention.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:833px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Staff put this into practice by noticing small behavior changes and verbally <br>acknowledging them to the youth, or even giving them a hug. Other more educationally-<br>oriented programs recognized that “some youth do not work well in a classroom setting, <br>and they need to be working one-on-one with someone,” as one instructor stated. These <br>programs were responsive to youth needs and planned their curriculum accordingly, <br>allowing students to choose how they wanted to learn. Youth reinforced this by noting <br>how much they enjoyed the one-on-one attention. This may be an indication of something <br>that is missing in other aspects of youth’s lives, especially in post-hurricane environments <br>where resources and energy are in short supply. As one parent and childcare provider <br>stated, “...children may not necessarily be getting the same thing they got from us before. <br>Because the hurricane used us up. It really did.” Receiving individualized positive </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">attention, as the funded programs provided, helps to instill a sense of security in youth, <br>and allows them to develop confidence in their abilities.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:150px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The programs also helped youth build relationships and socialize with each other, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:170px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">as well as with adults. In the current environment, youth have had to make significant <br>adjustments to people, places, and activities, and this has the potential to negatively <br>impact child development. Even children who returned to their homes found themselves <br>in a foreign environment that they had to adjust to. Parents seemed to be worried about <br>socialization of their children. One parent commented,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:294px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">...with this Katrina situation, it was hard for him (his son) at the time to <br>associate with other kids because in my neighborhood, we didn't have too <br>many other kids around at that point in the summer. You had a lot of <br>parents still debating whether or not to come home.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:398px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">By participating in these programs, the children and youth benefited from the opportunity<br>to meet new people and interact with other children, a healthy and normal developmental <br>process. One daycare provider described the change in one of the children from the <br>beginning to the end of the summer program: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:501px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Watching him at the beginning, he was real quiet. All he would do is read <br>books. Just really didn't want to talk. But by the end of the summer, he <br>was all playing. You know, back like, where he should be. You know <br>where he has friends...being like a normal 8 year old boy.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:605px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">In addition to practicing socialization during the programs, the children also </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:626px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">enhanced their own self-identity. For younger children, this was learning about a sense of <br>self. One parent observed the change in her daughter through playing with other children <br>at daycare: “She was very very shy until she first came here. And then she started <br>developing: I am Sally,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:685px;left:303px"><nobr><span class="ft7">5</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:688px;left:309px"><nobr><span class="ft0"> I have my own opinions, and I don't care what you say...I am </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:708px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">who I am.” Older children learned a bit more about individual perceptions and points of <br>view. A program director pointed out the role of art: “And the arts talk to them about <br>what do you think? Really getting at creative processes and personal perspective, and <br>who you are in the world, and what is your place in the community or the larger world.”<br>Moving through these stages of learning to play, learning to trust, learning how to be a <br>friend, learning who you are as an individual, and how you fit into your larger <br>community are important developmental steps, and the programs helped to ensure that <br>these youth were not delayed in experiencing them.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The funded programs introduced youth to a variety of new experiences. Youth </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:895px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">were exposed to new skills, creative outlets, technology, concepts, and knowledge. These <br>discoveries uncovered previously unexplored talents and competencies. Some examples <br>of unique opportunities for the children included filming a movie, writing songs that were<br>recorded onto a CD, learning digital photography programs, mastering yoga positions, <br>and quilting. One teaching artist recalled a child who excelled in photography:</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:293px"><nobr><span class="ft0"> just had this awesome eye...I mean, we want him to be a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:129px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">photographer or cinematographer or something, because the pictures that <br>this kid took were amazing. And they were doing stuff with the Photoshop <br>and he would come up with these awesome colors. And just superimpose <br>all kinds of....I mean this kid, he's got some vision that other kids ain't <br>seeing. Definitely.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:253px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Even for some of the youngest children, the programs provided stimulating activities. <br>One parent commented on the impact of daycare on her son: “Well I don't think it was <br>just a daycare. I mean he came home singing songs... he's learning, he's pretending. He's <br>not even two years old and he's already pretending. You know and that just blows my <br>mind...” Even on field trips accomplishments like getting strikes at bowling and skating <br>without falling down were meaningful for the children. These activities helped the youth <br>build self-esteem.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:398px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">In carrying the themes of knowledge and skill even further, the programs </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:419px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">contributed to a culture of learning for youth. The children’s activities, relationships, and <br>experiences expanded their perspectives and opened them up to new possibilities. One <br>summer camp brought in a group of young adults from New York to work with the <br>children, and guardians appreciated this “fresh perspective” and “new side of thinking.”<br>One child liked learning about New York, which he would not have otherwise been able <br>to do. Another parent noticed how his daughter had learned to write from different <br>perspectives. A literacy program taught one student about winter darkness in Scandinavia <br>and another about the length of time required to form a diamond. Both students were <br>enthusiastic about this new information. The instructor was too because, as she stated, <br>“this is what learning is all about. The surprise of learning something you didn’t know, <br>about other people somewhere else.” She continued,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">...there's a lot of these young people that really want to learn. They come <br>in here and they're writing...they're reading, they're asking questions. They <br>really want to know. They realize that they're missing something. They <br>know that. That's a sad thing, but it's also a good thing.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:771px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">It is a good thing because it inspires youth to reach for something; to extend their abilities <br>and their realm of knowing. These programs have been able to respond to that. As one <br>father put it, “Programs like this give the kids a chance to see something brighter. To say, <br>hey, I’m not going to settle.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft3"><b>Strengths of Grantees</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:915px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The organizations and programs evaluated exhibited strengths that contributed to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:936px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft13">their positive impact on the youth, families, and communities. These strengths should be <br>noted as strategies and values that all youth-oriented programs should seek to embody.<br>One such strategy was a holistic approach to programming through recognizing the need <br>to work with the entire family, rather than the youth in isolation. The ability to look<br>beyond surface issues to identify underlying situations that may be contributing to <br>                                                </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">problems is another effective approach. Many programs were able to either address these <br>directly, or provide referrals for other services.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:150px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Programs also strove to reduce barriers to receiving services by making it difficult </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:170px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">for youth and families to find reasons not to participate. Some examples are solving <br>transportation issues with rides or bus tokens, providing childcare for parents who were<br>themselves receiving services, and subsidizing costs. This required awareness on the part <br>of program implementers, and sensitivity to the issues their clients were struggling with. <br>One adult education program waived the traditional requirements to signing up for their <br>program. If youth had lost their student ID, social security card, or birth certificate, they <br>were still allowed to participate. This kind of approach ensures that everyone who would <br>like help has access to it.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:336px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Another strength many of these programs exhibited was flexibility and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:357px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">adaptability. They were responsive to the needs of their clients, and were willing and able <br>to modify their programming accordingly, rather than putting the onus on the youth and <br>families to change. Some had difficulties finding locations to hold youth programs in the <br>damaged communities, but were resourceful and creative in solutions. Others were forced <br>to go door-to-door to recruit children for summer programs as traditional communication <br>networks were lacking. The program implementers were insightful, creative, sensitive, <br>and tenacious in getting valuable services to those who needed them. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:523px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft3"><b>Program Limitations</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:564px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Though the programs’ positive impacts have been significant and even </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:584px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">immeasurable in the extent to which they may have guided or influenced these youth, <br>some limitations must be noted. The nature of a grant is that it imposes time restrictions <br>on program implementation. These grantees would have been even more successful with <br>their programs if they had fewer restrictions on time. In some cases, program staff voiced <br>a desire to continue their programs, but had run out of time. For many programs success <br>depended on relationships formed between the implementers, and the youth and families. <br>One teacher at an early childhood center offering mental health counseling spoke about <br>the parents’ readiness to access mental health services: “...they need it, but they’re not to <br>the point...to where they’re open enough to let you in.” It takes time to establish trust and <br>many programs felt that they had formed productive relationships just as their programs <br>were ending. As one teaching artist said, “we were consistent for four weeks in the <br>summer and look what came of that. Just think the impact we’ll have with the kids over a <br>longer period of time.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:853px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Related to time are issues of sustainability. Many programs spoke of the need to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">offer continuous services by maintaining a long-term presence in the community. Some <br>programs were in the process of looking for funding to continue their services, but were <br>uncertain about the future of their programs. Several also voiced concern over what <br>would happen next summer when even more children have returned to the area. The <br>funding certainly realized its goal of providing temporary assistance and bridging gaps in <br>services until organizations and communities could regroup, but long-term responses to <br>youth needs are also necessary.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:150px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Many needs, gaps, and problems were identified by those who participated in the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:170px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">evaluation. Well over one year after Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf Coast region is still <br>struggling with fundamental deficiencies in social services and basic standards of living. <br>Some, such as lack of affordable housing, governmental inefficiency, displacement, and <br>poverty, though mentioned often by respondents and often the root cause of problems, lie <br>outside the scope of recommendations offered in this evaluation. These issues <br>undoubtedly deserve attention, but this document will focus on issues that lend <br>themselves to simpler solutions easily implemented in future assistance programs.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:336px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Needs and Gaps</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:377px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Social service and assistance programs are inadequate to meet the needs of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:398px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">populations in Southeastern Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. Even very basic necessities, <br>such as housing, are still missing for some. In some cases, these were pre-existing needs <br>that have been exacerbated by the hurricane. The director of a program for young adults <br>described the realities for her clients: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:501px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">They're just missing the basic sort of secure home environments that most <br>people just take for granted. They may or may not have a home to go to. <br>They may or may not have a bed in that house. They may or may not have <br>food in the kitchen. They may or may not have electricity. They may or <br>may not have a washer/dryer. They may or may not have quarters to wash <br>their own clothes...Like very basic things that we're dealing with that are <br>just not being taken into consideration.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">These programs helped to fill a gap for many families, but the supply of services has not <br>been adequate to fill the demand. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:708px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">In instances where the services and assistance do exist, the lack of communication</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:729px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">and information dissemination makes them unattainable for those who do not know how <br>to access them. Reliable information is in short supply. As one parent said, “Information<br>is the reason we’re in this boat that we’re in right now.” A daycare owner expending <br>considerable effort to access help for her clients described her plight as “a fight.” The <br>hurricane damage broke down communication networks and people in need do not know <br>how to access help.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:853px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Several respondents expressed concerns over environmental hygiene. Some </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">individuals referred to “toxic soils” and even “death and destruction spores” as colorful <br>descriptions for the environmental hazards caused by oil spills and Katrina damage. <br>Whether or not these fears have been supported with scientific findings, they are real <br>fears of people living in these communities, and certainly impact their perceived quality <br>of life. In some cases, because of these anxieties and the lack of health care facilities, <br>families have elected not to bring elderly family members back into these environments.<br>Providing childcare support in some families, the missing grandparents decrease the <br>number of resources parents have to rely on.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Weakened social support networks were another challenge identified by the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:129px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">evaluation. Fewer resources and mounting stressors are contributing to unstable home <br>environments. Families are forced into uncomfortable living situations such as small <br>trailers, or sharing a house with extended family. As one parent said, “No one knows how <br>to fully deal with this.” Pre-existing domestic problems have been exacerbated by the <br>effects of the hurricane and children are caught in the middle of these tensions, and even <br>explosions. The erosion of social support networks is taking its toll on care givers and <br>children alike.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:274px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Mental health counseling and emotional support was another identified need. One </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:294px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft0">parent recognized this:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:336px;left:243px"><nobr><span class="ft6">So the entire community is absolutely devastated. And people are not <br>dealing with it well. We have 70 year old couples who are committing <br>suicide together. You know, I mean, just people don't know how to deal <br>with it, and then on top of that, there's no mental clarity. And no one has <br>ever been through this before, so there's no guide to help you.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:460px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Youth program implementers also observed this need in their work with children. One <br>teaching artist commented, “I see a real need for mental health counselors to work with <br>kids. I think there's a lot of...unhealthy stuff going around that's unchecked, that gets <br>ignored.” Youth that have trouble expressing themselves may be led to destructive <br>manifestations of their emotional issues. This is also a concern for adults as many believe <br>that abuse has escalated in post-Katrina environments.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:584px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Respondents also reported that youth have nothing positive to do in their free </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:605px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">time. Recreational outlets and activities are missing in many communities. Youth felt <br>particularly strongly about access to fun activities and having somewhere to “just go, <br>listen to music, play basketball, just chill” as one young man expressed. Adults were <br>more concerned about the alternative activities youth were engaging in. As one parent <br>said, “The youth are at a breaking point where they can go the good way, or the bad <br>way...So if something specific is not implemented rather quickly, you know, we have a <br>serious situation on our hands.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:750px;left:194px"><nobr><span class="ft0">  </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:771px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Opportunities for Intervention</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:812px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The needs identified by this evaluation lend themselves to areas for programmatic </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:833px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">intervention. Strengthened social service networks and organizational collaborations is <br>one such way to approach community recovery. Enhanced cooperation would improve <br>how information is shared and disseminated in communities. If community needs were <br>promptly defined, and organizations collectively planned their interventions and shared <br>resources, services would be provided much more efficiently. Information on services <br>would likely also be easier to access. This opportunity for intervention is applicable not <br>only to youth-oriented services, but to all community work.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:978px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Another opportunity for intervention is the provision of emotional support and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:998px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">mental health services. An important aspect of this approach would be education for <br>parents and guardians addressing the impact of stress on youth, as well as techniques to <br>address it. Many teachers, childcare workers, and parents believed that adults did not </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:191px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">interventions, basic human needs must be fulfilled. Issues such as housing and physical <br>health should be programmatic priorities. Concrete services through case management to <br>meet these basic needs are an essential component to any intervention that hopes to <br>improve the welfare of children. Rising costs of insurance, rent, and utilities have created <br>a climate of chronic financial stress for families in this post-disaster environment, and<br>people need guidance and assistance in moving forward with recovery.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:315px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Additionally, the creation of safe recreational spaces to engage youth is another </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:336px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">programmatic opportunity. Violence in varying degrees and forms has become a regular <br>and familiar experience for youth, even on a daily basis.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:522px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Coast Youth Program Recovery Fund. Using these successes, the strengths of the <br>organizations, and the needs identified by the program implementers, the youth, and their <br>parents and guardians, this evaluation concludes by offering several recommendations to <br>inform future youth programming in post-disaster environments.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:626px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft0">General themes to be considered and incorporated in any youth program include:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:646px;left:158px"><nobr><span class="ft11"> <i>Normalcy through structured activities and consistent programming.</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667px;left:180px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Providing some stabilization in the midst of disorganization is important for the <br>emotional health and development of children. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:708px;left:158px"><nobr><span class="ft11"> <i>Individualized positive attention. </i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:729px;left:180px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Youth need and crave this attention, and are often deprived of it when families<br>experience stress and schools suffer a strain on resources and personnel.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:770px;left:158px"><nobr><span class="ft11"> <i>Inclusion of family.</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:791px;left:180px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Care givers and families should be incorporated into interventions as much as <br>possible. Stress in children may be a symptom of problems at home, and parental <br>participation is an important component of youth work.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:853px;left:158px"><nobr><span class="ft11"> <i>Trusting relationships.</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:180px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Providing effective services requires trusting relationships between program <br>implementers, and youth and their guardians. Trust is achieved by demonstrating a <br>commitment to the community through consistent service delivery, or by <br>partnering with a trusted community entity.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:957px;left:158px"><nobr><span class="ft11"> <i>Fulfillment of basic needs.</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:978px;left:180px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Basic human needs must be met before positive youth development can occur. <br>Ensuring that housing, food, health, and a general sense of safety are established <br>should be priorities in youth programming.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:209px;left:332px"><nobr><span class="ft14"><i>7</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:253px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Community centers were often mentioned as a need by those who participated in </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:274px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">the evaluation. These centers would allow not only youth, but all community members to <br>access resources such as after school care, adult education programs, recreational sports <br>and activities, community meetings, case management, and counseling. The center site<br>would be a local high school or middle school. Using a school as the physical site is <br>practical because it is an entity and location with which all community members are <br>familiar. Families have established relationships with schools making it more likely for <br>them to access services and activities there. An additional benefit is that a center like this <br>has the potential to draw in parents and guardians who are less involved with their <br>children’s scholastic activities. Providing free and needed services in a familiar location <br>is a strategy that could combat this apathy. Providing so many services in one place is <br>also convenient for community members. The schools/centers would stay open until the <br>late evening to accommodate all schedules.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:543px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Youth Drop-In Centers</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:584px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">A drop-in center is another vision of program implementers stemming from the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:605px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">needs of the at-risk youth they work with. This type of center would serve youth only and<br>would ideally be open 24 hours a day. It would serve several functions, the most <br>important of which would be a safe place for youth as an alternative to being on the <br>street, or in an unsafe home environment. Not only would it provide a refuge, but it <br>would have showers, a kitchen, and recreational space. Additionally, case management <br>would be available, as well as career counseling and job training. A drop-in center has the <br>potential to reduce youth exposure to violence while also providing positive resources, <br>assistance, and services to individuals who are growing up in disadvantaged <br>environments.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:812px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Community-Based Mentorship</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:853px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Adults working with the youth recognized and expressed concern over the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft15">disconnect that occurs in communities during an individual’s transition from childhood to <br>young adulthood. This relates to the theme of learned responsibility that surfaced often <br>during discussions of youth programming. Youth need guidance along their journey to <br>adulthood and presently, that seems to be lacking for them. Mentorship programs would <br>be a way to increase the positive individual attention that is so important to healthy youth <br>development, while also imparting life skills, encouraging identity formation, and <br>teaching social responsibility. While this learning occurs formally or informally for some <br>                                                </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Mental health counseling is an important intervention to have in place in post-</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:253px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">disaster environments. Youth and families are struggling with experiences and stressors <br>that they have never encountered before. They often do not know how to handle and <br>integrate these stressful and even traumatic experiences, and find themselves stuck, <br>unable to move forward. Additionally, families have to confront chronic sources of stress, <br>such as rebuilding and financial burdens even after the disaster has passed on. <br>Professional support may be necessary to navigate these emotions and learn tools to <br>master them. Advocacy through case management would also be a component of services <br>to aid families in obtaining concrete assistance. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:419px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">To effectively implement a program like this, the culture surrounding mental </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:439px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">health support and assistance would need to be demystified and de-stigmatized. Including <br>an educational component for all parents would help to normalize mental health support <br>while increasing awareness of available services. It would also inform parents of the <br>effect their emotions, and how they handle them, have on their children. These services <br>would be provided in the schools because they are familiar, trusted, and convenient <br>entities for parents and guardians. Because it is not unusual for parents to be in the <br>schools meeting with teachers and staff, they would benefit from a degree of anonymity <br>with respect to the kinds of services they are receiving.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:626px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft3"><b>Conclusion</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The Gulf Coast Youth Program Recovery Fund made it possible for programs to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:688px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">offer innovative youth services to communities and families with significant needs for <br>various types of assistance. The impact of the grants program was powerful. The youth <br>programs it funded contributed to rebuilding healthy communities, renewing capacities of <br>service-providing organizations, supporting parents and families, and encouraging <br>positive youth development. Specific impacts on the beneficiaries included establishing <br>normalcy and structure in damaged communities; giving parents the time and peace of <br>mind to work on their families’ recovery; facilitating social reconnections and fostering <br>new relationships; providing support for youth and adults struggling with hurricane-<br>related stress; imbuing youth with self-confidence through discovery of new skills and <br>positive attention; and creating a culture of learning and social responsibility. By <br>improving youth welfare, especially at this pivotal point in hurricane recovery, the youth <br>grants fund has made a meaningful contribution to the youth participants, their families, <br>and the communities they live in. This contribution is long-lasting because it has the <br>potential to influence youth and the decisions they make in their futures.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:978px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The evaluation also identified persistent needs and problems of beneficiaries and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:998px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">their communities. These needs are significant but lend themselves to workable solutions<br>to consider for future assistance programs. In general, a lack of social assistance, weak <br>information dissemination systems, feeble social support networks, a lack of mental </span></nobr></DIV>

In response to these needs, specific recommendations <br>offered by this evaluation include community centers, youth drop-in centers, community-<br>based mentorship programs, and school-based mental health support and case <br>management. In any effective youth intervention however, the following elements should <br>be included: normalcy through structured activities, individualized positive attention, <br>inclusion of family members, cultivation of trusting relationships, and fulfillment of basic <br>needs. The ideas and recommendations offered in this evaluation provide a guide to<br>inform future youth programming in post-disaster environments to ensure effective <br>recovery and improve the welfare of children, their families, and communities.  </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:212px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">funded by the Gulf Coast Youth Program Recovery Fund on youth participants, their <br>families, and the communities in which they live. Eight programs from Louisiana and <br>Mississippi were selected by Mercy Corps to represent the 80 grant recipients. Over a <br>period of four weeks, the evaluator collected data through focus groups and in-depth <br>interviews with youth participants, their parents and guardians, and implementers of the <br>youth programs.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:357px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Materials</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:398px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Faculty from Tulane University’s School of Social Work developed general focus </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:419px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">group and interview guides. The evaluator adapted the guides to each program, making <br>them specifically relevant to the program activities. The questions were also modified <br>slightly throughout the course of data collection based on which ones elicited the richest <br>responses.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:501px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Consent and assent forms for the adult and youth participants were developed by </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:522px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">Tulane faculty as well. Each participant reviewed and signed a form before the interview <br>or focus group to ensure that they understood the purpose of the evaluation, their role in <br>it, potential risks to participation, confidentiality of responses, and their right to terminate <br>their participation at any time. For children under the age of 16, parents signed a consent <br>while the children signed assent forms.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:646px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Confidentiality</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:688px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Confidentiality of responses was explained fully in the consent forms, and was </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:708px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">again reviewed orally by the evaluator at the beginning of each interview or focus group. <br>Participants were assured that no names would be used in the evaluation, and that all <br>written and audio records of interview sessions would be destroyed upon completion of <br>the evaluation. Confidentiality was protected even further by omitting the names of <br>organizations throughout the report. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:833px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Data Collection</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">The process of data collection consisted of digitally voice recording each focus </span></nobr></DIV>

When possible, a back up voice recorder was used. During focus <br>groups, the evaluator moderated the sessions while an assistant took notes on nonverbal <br>commentary and transitions in speakers. The interview and focus group sessions were set <br>up by program staff in locations familiar to all participants (a school, daycare center, or <br>local church) to maximize their comfortability. Refreshments were also provided to <br>convey appreciation for participants’ contributions.<br>                                                </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:170px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Once the data was organized and transcribed, it was reviewed by not only the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:191px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">evaluator, but by Mercy Corps staff and a Tulane School of Social Work faculty member. <br>These individuals met to discuss the different themes emerging from the data and how <br>best to organize them. This triangulation ensured that a variety of perspectives <br>contributed to shaping the final document. Once the major ideas were identified, the <br>evaluator coded the content of all transcripts into thematic groups and subgroups. These <br>groupings became the sections of the report and the final document was written and given <br>to Mercy Corps.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:357px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Limitations</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:398px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">One weakness of the evaluation methodology was the influence social desirability </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:419px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">may have had on the participants’ responses. The participants were the beneficiaries of <br>the funding provided by Mercy Corps and may have felt a need to amplify positive <br>aspects of the programming. The program implementers may have been particularly <br>susceptible to this bias. It is also possible that focus groups forums encouraged excessive <br>agreement amongst participants, and discouraged responses perceived as disagreeable or <br>irrelevant. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:543px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">It is impossible to know to what extent this bias may have crept into the data, but </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:564px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">efforts were made to minimize it. An important component of the introduction to the <br>focus groups and interviews was to establish impartiality to the outcome of the session. <br>The evaluator clarified that she did not work with or for Mercy Corps, but was hired by a <br>third party to conduct the evaluation. She also deflected all attempts to thank her for the <br>funding and instead assured the participants that she would pass on their gratitude to <br>Mercy Corps. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:688px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Another limitation to this evaluation was the variation in the amount of data </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:708px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">collected for each organization. This was dependent on who was willing and available to <br>participate. For only one organization was data collected from all groups: youth, parents, <br>and program implementers. Sessions also varied in the richness of responses and data <br>elicited.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:791px;left:189px"><nobr><span class="ft0">Finally, in some sessions that included youth participants, they were too young to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:812px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft6">provide the kind of responses that this evaluation sought. Sometimes it was too difficult <br>to hold their attention and these sessions tended to be short and full of less relevant <br>comments. Even so, it was important to include their perspectives and let their voices be <br>heard in this youth grants evaluation.</span></nobr></DIV>
