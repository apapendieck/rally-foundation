<DIV style="position:absolute;top:154px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft4"> <br>The Executive Office for Weed and Seed (EOWS) has distributed millions of dollars in <br>Federal support to distressed communities throughout the United States since 1991.  With <br>a mission that focuses crime intervention and prevention efforts into some of the nation's <br>most crime ridden areas, Weed and Seed has a large stake in assuring programmatic <br>effectiveness.  At it's most dramatic, the effectiveness of Weed and Seed programs can be <br>a matter of life and death - by eliminating crime and disorder, including elimination of <br>the drug trade and attendant violence, violent crime, gang activity, and homicide. <br> <br>It is at this most basic level - life and death - that EOWS has developed an annual <br>measure of effectiveness.  Through reporting for the Government Performance and <br>Results Act (GPRA), Weed and Seed sites report trends in homicide for both their target <br>area, and for the encompassing jurisdiction.  No program of this size should rely on only <br>one measure of effectiveness, however and over the years, EOWS has actively pursued <br>multiple approaches for developing evaluation information on the effectiveness and <br>promise of the Weed and Seed strategy.  This has included nationally directed evaluation <br>efforts as well as locally initiated studies. <br> <br>Other recent national efforts include a crime pattern data collection project that solicits <br>crime data from grantees for crimes that are the priority of an individual site.  Collected <br>for a six year period, which includes statistics preceding project implementation and for <br>several years afterwards, this data will help show the degree to which grantees impact <br>those crimes that are their communities’ major concerns as identified in their Weed and <br>Seed strategies.  The Performance Indicators project, also currently underway, relies on <br>geo-spatial analysis to shed light on program effectiveness. <br> <br>EOWS encourages local evaluation efforts in addition to these national efforts, providing <br>resources and technical assistance for sites to conduct proper evaluations.  Some of the <br>fruit of these efforts is presented in this summary of local Weed and Seed evaluation.  <br>Though of varying degrees of complexity and with findings that are not universal, these <br>studies add to the body of work developed to explore the effectiveness of the Weed and <br>Seed strategy at both the local and national level.  Because of the wide scope of many <br>local Weed and Seed strategies, it is often not feasible with the available resources to <br>examine all aspects of a local site’s activities to the same depth.  Consequently, some <br>variations across these studies are due to the specific focus of individual investigators. <br> <br>This meta analysis reviews and summarizes: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:318px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft4"> <br>As previously stated, these evaluations have been conducted for both local use and <br>national level assessments and as such lose some of their comparability.  All these <br>studies, however, attempt to determine the effect of Weed and Seed efforts on local <br>communities.   <br> <br>Overall, the evaluations have generally found significant improvements in community <br>crime conditions, residents’ attitudes were positive regarding changes occurring in the <br>target areas, and increased interagency coordination and cooperation through <br>participation in the Weed and Seed strategy.  Because local sites may be addressing a <br>broad range of crime, social, educational, housing, and economic development issues, <br>their progress can be affected by many organizational development concerns, institutional <br>barriers, and funding limits that less comprehensive efforts do not contend with.  Several <br>studies have noted instances where such difficulties may have prevented or delayed full <br>implementation of planned strategies.  Despite the challenges of this complexity, local <br>sites can often show substantial progress in some objectives while making inroads in <br>others.    <br> <br>Some of the more noteworthy observations for individual sites include: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>

Though the resources <br>available for the research effort were limited, the San Diego experience, as revealed in <br>this report, provides valuable information for future efforts to positively impact distressed <br>and crime-ridden communities, both locally and across the nation. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>The specific impact of the Weed and Seed Initiative on the target community was <br>difficult to document through the available data. It was difficult to associate changes <br>occurring during the Weed and Seed project with actual program activities and outcomes. <br>However, the program did focus on a community in need based on sociodemographic <br>data and crime measures. Findings supporting the positive influence of the Initiative <br>include the following. <br> <br>- Overall, crime declined based on calls for service, reported crime, and arrest data, and <br>there was no evidence of crime displacement into the surrounding community. <br>- The response of the justice system to criminal activity in the area became more <br>aggressive after the implementation of the Weed and Seed project. <br>- Target area residents and merchants reported positive ratings of the police through <br>interviews and surveys. <br>- Many Weed and Seed strategies were consistent with the needs of the community (e.g., <br>more officers on the street, improvement of police-community relations). <br> <br>The following study results suggest areas for improvement as Weed and Seed efforts, or <br>similar programs, continue to address troubled communities. <br>- Several areas within the target site continue to be crime ridden. <br>- The majority of probation revocations for probationers residing within the target area <br>were the result of individuals failing to report to their probation officer and disappearing </span></nobr></DIV>

Slightly less than a quarter (23%) of residents <br>and 40 percent of merchants rated their community. as a good place to live or conduct <br>business. Over half noted that this rating remained unchanged compared to one year <br>earlier. <br>- The specific problems in the target area requiring attention varied across groups (i.e., <br>residents, merchants, and law enforcement officers). For residents and police, drug-<br>related crime was the most frequently cited problem, while merchants noted graffiti most <br>often. However, all three groups agreed that gang activity was a problem for the <br>community. <br>- Reporting of victimization, according to resident interviews, was below actual <br>occurrence levels. Further, opportunity for participation in problem solving with police <br>was curtailed by time constraints and child care issues. <br>- Education measures (i.e., scholastic test scores, truancy, and school drop-outs) remained <br>relatively unchanged. <br>- Based on the number of new businesses and jobs emerging in the Weed and Seed area <br>over time, the business climate did not seem to be impacted by the Initiative. <br>- There was a lack of consensus among program participants (i.e., Executive Steering <br>Committee and Neighborhood Council) regarding the methods for achieving program <br>goals and decision-making authority. </span></nobr></DIV>

This evalution covered the first two years of <br>program implementaion and focused on four areas; steering committee, weeding, and <br>seeding activities as well as budget allocation.  Data collection measures included <br>steering committee observations and interviews, interviews with program implementation <br>staff, and a review of the program budget.  Police data (calls for service, drug calls for <br>service, number of personal crimes, and property felonies) was analyzed and a <br>comparison was made between this data for the site area and the rest of New Britain for <br>the years 1993-1998 that enabled crime trends to be examined before and after program <br>inception. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>Results first provided a description of the weeding and seeding program activities.  <br>Notable weeding activities consisted of the gun abatement program which targeted drug <br>dealers and illegal weapons through increased police presence in gun crime &quot;hot spots&quot; <br>and the Community Action Team that stepped up police patrols to reduce open air drug <br>markets and minor violations.  The MARCH (Multi-Agency Response to Community <br>Hot Spots) program was provided assistance by the weed and seed program to provide <br>government inspections of local businesses.  Seeding strategies consisted of a coalition <br>between police, public, and private agencies to strengthen the site with numerous social, <br>economic, and housing improvement progams.  The weed and seed program also <br>established funding for neighborhood revitalization as well as adult and youth <br>programming.  The analysis of police data noted two major findings after program <br>inception; there were significant differences in regards to calls for service and drug calls <br>for servcie between the weed and seed site and the rest of the city.  There was found to be <br>an increase in calls for service within the weed and seed site for the first year of the <br>program with a decrease in the second year.  The report concluded that the increase was <br>due to the success of community policing, as site residents felt more comfortable in <br>calling the police to report crimes, and the increased police presence of the weeding <br>strategies.  The decrease the next year was attributed to the actual reduction in crime </span></nobr></DIV>

Other <br>methods include Weed and Seed committee meeting minutes and quarterly reports; and, <br>from crime data bases aggregated by both target area and city-wide crime incident data. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>By any measure, the analysis of crime data in the target area for the four-year period <br>shows that Weed and Seed neighborhoods are still severely over-represented by violence, <br>drugs, public nuisances, and simple assaults.  In sum, the frequency of crime over the life <br>of the Weed and Seed project has changed little. <br> <br>What to make of these findings?  From its inception, annual federal funding for the <br>Savannah Weed and Seed Project declined 72 percent (from $790,000 to $225,000). As a <br>result, police staffing levels in the target area dropped.  Indeed, a difficulty in surveying <br>police for this study was in finding personnel still assigned to the target area. As funding <br>decreased, interest in the project waned.  Management reassigned officers to other areas <br>and other duties demanding their urgent attention.  <br> <br>Despite the funding decline, target area residents’ favorable perceptions of the quality of <br>police services persisted and, on some items, actually increased from 1997 to 1999.  This <br>was the case in spite of the prevailing opinion that inter-agency cooperation and <br>collaboration could have been better, particularly between SPD and CNT officers. <br>Paradoxically, as funding decreased, officer opinions about the adequacy of resources to <br>implement the program did not change. Officers of one agency believed, on the whole, <br>that staffing, equipment, and materiel were adequate to the task. Another agency’s <br>officers consistently maintained that the resources were sparse and the management of <br>those resources deficient. <br> </span></nobr></DIV>

Such measures <br>included observations plus resident, business, and Weed and Seed Executive Commitee <br>surveys and interviews conducted with local vendors, law enforcement, the courts, <br>residents, weed and seed staff, business owners, and other partners.  An analysis of crime <br>data and weed and seed meeting minutes, records, and documents was undertaken as <br>well. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>Project findings were broken down into the four main components of weed and seed <br>programming: (1) law enforcement, (2) community policing, (3) intervention, prevention, <br>and treatment, and (4) neighborhood restoration and economic development.  The law <br>enforcement component was seen by many as a dramatic success due to a consistent <br>commitment by agenices along with highly visible actions.  Drug offenses within the site <br>were reduced by half from 1997 to 2001 and part I and part II crimes within the site area <br>were reduced by 75.5% and 69.5% between 1997 and 2000.  The Weed and Seed court, <br>the federal prosecution of drug dealers, and georaphic restriction imposed for site <br>offenders were a few highlights of law enforcement programming.  Results also indicated <br>that site residents feel safer since weed and seed implementation amid concerns about the <br>displacement of crime.  Community policing initiatives were noted with the increased <br>support of citizen patrols that were deemed to have a positive impact but also a need to <br>sustain participation over the long term.  The resident survey revealed that more than half <br>of the residents felt that police responsiveness to community concerns was above <br>satisfactory.  A substantial amount of residents also saw a visible level of interaction <br>between police and the community at neighborhood events.  Overall, &quot;Seeding&quot; programs <br>(componenets 3 and 4) were seen to make progress but with a recent decrease in <br>participation.  Successful program impementation of &quot;Seeding&quot; activities was seen as <br>much more diffcult compared to strategies of &quot;Weeding&quot;.  Intervention, prevention, and <br>treatment programming teamed with community policing efforts to establish safe havens <br>where multiple services were provided; academic tutoring, computer classes, anti-drug <br>education, community projects, health screening, mentoring, and recrerational </span></nobr></DIV>

This <br>report summarizes the information gathered and includes recommendations for ongoing <br>planning and implementation by the Des Moines Weed and Seed site to strengthen the <br>project. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>In general, the Des Moines Weed and Seed site has followed its strategic plan fairly <br>closely over the first few years of implementation.  While some specific tasks discussed <br>in the original plan submitted in 1995 have not been carried out and others added as <br>funding, needs and priorities changed, the overall direction of the effort has remained the <br>same.   <br> <br>An analysis of data available from the DMPD reveals that crime decreased significantly <br>in the target area from 1994 to 1997.  This decrease is likely the result of a combination <br>of factors, with the Weed and Seed efforts among them.   <br> <br>The Safe Haven element of the plan has added value to the target area, according to <br>several people interviewed for this evaluation.  The Weed and Seed initiative has <br>leveraged its limited resources in several ways.  Weed and Seed funds are often used to <br>supplement other funding streams, and are infrequently the sole source of funding for a <br>program.  By building on existing programs and partnering with other organizations, the <br>Weed and Seed funds have been stretched to provide a wide variety of services and <br>opportunities, such as arts programming, job training, and educational services, that <br>would otherwise be very limited, if present at all, in the target area.   <br> <br>While there appears to be a general perception that conditions have improved in the Des <br>Moines Weed and Seed target area and that the combination of various initiatives have <br>had positive  results, most also agree that more needs to be done.

In conducting this evaluation, the Massachusetts SAC analyzed and mapped <br>data detailing police calls for service. <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>As the city of Woburn approaches its fourth year of Weed and Seed funding, a <br>preliminary review of the program operation has found the involved agencies have <br>implemented the program as initially designed. Weed and Seed continues to operate as an <br>umbrella program, under which multiple initiatives target a population containing various <br>needs and issues. Although this study had identified the volume of seeding activities <br>currently operating in the City, a closer examination of these initiatives would be <br>beneficial in determining the impact they have had on the city’s residents. <br> <br>The Statistical Analysis Center anticipates the identification of hot spots will be useful to <br>the Woburn Weed and Seed administrators in highlighting areas that might need <br>additional resources, and may also provide indications of possible crime displacement. In <br>planning for this study, it was initially hypothesized that calls for service would increase <br>as the community becomes more involved with the idea of helping the police to solve <br>problems and their confidence and belief in their efforts increases. As demonstrated in <br>this report, an interesting trend was experienced in Weed and Seed Area: calls decreased <br>slightly (1%) in 1996 over 1995, then increased 4% in 1997, and again decreased (2%) in <br>1998 to reach the same call volume experienced in 1995. What is more interesting to <br>examine are the changes that have occurred over time within the different Weed and Seed <br>areas. The emergence of robbery incidents where they were previously never executed, <br>and the significant decrease in disturbance calls are a few examples of where police can <br>gain insight into their community’s crime problems. Overall, crime in Woburn has <br>decreased consistently over the four-year period. Whether this trend can be attributed to <br>the weeding of criminals off the city streets or the seeding of programs for residents <br>in need of services, is a topic that warrants further study. </span></nobr></DIV>

Researchers <br>attended numerous meetings of the Weed and Seed truancy committee in an effort to <br>identify issues raised by program developers and key stakeholders. Interviews were <br>conducted with program administrators and primary service providers. Data on each <br>student involved in the program were obtained from Grand Rapids Public Schools. In <br>addition, school data were matched with data received from agencies providing services <br>to the families of identified truants.  This data were analyzed in an effort to assess <br>intervention effectiveness. <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>The results of this evaluation illustrate significant progress in reducing elementary <br>truancy.  Following the first two interventions (receiving a letter and being visited by the <br>attendance officer), absenteeism decreased for students in the program.  The program was <br>most successful for chronic truants, or youth who missed twenty percent or more of total <br>school days prior to the initial letter.  When the chronic truancy group was isolated from <br>those who missed less than twenty percent, absenteeism was reduced by 50%. <br> <br>Program implementation closely corresponded with the model that was initially <br>developed, however deviations were observed at several stages, including truancy <br>identification, the referrals process, interagency communication, and information sharing.   <br> <br>There are several implications of the findings of this evaluation.  First, it appears that <br>significant improvement can be made with chronic truants using this model.  <br>Concentrating efforts on this population would enhance the program's success and <br>streamline the process for school officials with limited resources.  At the same time, <br>students with less serious attendance problems might be better served by a different type <br>of program.  Second, the importance of a program coordinator to oversee the initiative <br>cannot be overstated.  A coordinator could work with all stakeholders and assure that the <br>model is being implemented as it was designed.  Third, active participation by the Grand <br>Rapids Public Schools Research and Evaluation Unit is critical for resolving data <br>collection and information sharing concerns.   <br> </span></nobr></DIV>

Crime statistics <br>were provided by the Kansas City Police Department. The Boys and Girls Club provided <br>information about their programs. Residents' opinions were obtained during telephone <br>interviews conducted with a random sample of 200 community residents. The sample <br>size had a confidence level of 95% confidence, with a precision of +/- 7%. The purpose <br>of the survey was to obtain opinions from residents in the Westside area about changes <br>within their neighborhoods during the year the Weed and Seed Program was in effect. <br>These opinions were used to help assess how well the program achieved its goals. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>The Weed and Seed Program was successful based on both quantitative crime data, youth <br>participation in Boys and Girls Clubs activities and resident perceptions about changes in <br>their neighborhood during the year July 1995 through June 1996. <br> <br>Unlike property crime, which was immediately effected by the Weed and Seed Program, <br>violent crime took longer to effect. One of the reasons for the lagged reduction in violent <br>crime as compared to the reduction in property crime could be that reductions in violent <br>crime require more than just increased policing. The increased number of police patrols <br>in the area probably represented an immediate deterrent to property crimes. Over time, <br>the increased level of policing combined with community participation may have <br>changed attitudes and the culture in the neighborhood enough that violent crime levels <br>began to decline a year after the program was implemented. <br> <br>Of the hundreds of children who participated in the SMART program at the West Bluff <br>and Oak Park Clubs, 558 completed a survey at the end of their participation. The survey <br>assessed the impact the program had on the child's attitudes toward drug and alcohol <br>abuse. The detailed results are shown in a later section of this report. For each of the 24 <br>items, a large majority of the children responded that their attitudes had improved. For <br>example, <br> <br>66% Reported that their attitude toward tobacco had improved. </span></nobr></DIV>

The Meadows Village target area did not show a similar <br>reduction in crime.  The study authors suggest that the latter area's characteristics make it <br>more difficult to effect significant change.  In both target areas, program participants <br>have reported improvements in their quality of life, in terms of newfound personal <br>efficacy and increased social capital.  These outcomes can be seen most clearly in <br>improved life skills, language proficiency, and job readiness. <br> <br>Organizational and fiscal management problems experienced by the Site led to <br>recommendations for greater Federal oversight and technical support. </span></nobr></DIV>

Research methodology consisted of email, telephone, or <br>mail surveys of steering committee members, &quot;persons of contact&quot; of partner <br>organizations, program participants, and site residents along with an interview of the site <br>coordiantor and observations of steering committee meetings. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>The survey of the steering committee revealed that the committee had oversight and <br>representation responsibilities along with high expectations for programming and an <br>understanding of the general purpose of the weed and seed strategy. A major challenge of <br>the committee was to sustain the interest and commitment of members.  Recently, the <br>committee has become more active in weed and seed programming and has started to <br>more clearly define its role.  Respondents noted that the biggest success of the weed and <br>seed campaign were the programs implemented in the community.  The biggest <br>challenges facing the overall strategy was reported as the inability to get program <br>recognition in the community.  The committee also noted that there was conflict between <br>them and their fiscal agent (Community Services Agency) due to differing goals, <br>interests, and assets.  Committee recommendations for change included increasing the <br>community awareness of the strategy, increasing community program participation, and <br>insuring that community programs have a lasting and positve effect.  The site coordinator <br>interview revealed that major challenges to her position and the weed and seed strategy <br>include getting the steering committee to make decisions and increasing resident <br>participation in programs.  Notable success, according to the site coordinator, included <br>multiple community programs and the site's relationship with the police department.  The <br>site coordiantor also revealed that the biggest challenge in administering program <br>strategy lies in the conflict between the steering committee and the fiscal agent as they <br>differ on who is the decision making body of the strategy. In regards to change, the site <br>coordinator hopes to have a new fiscal agent and increased community participation in <br>programs.

A number of contacts from partner agencies were unable to be contacted, most <br>notably the Community Service Agency workers who are an instrumental part in the <br>strategy.  A phone and mail survey of program participants yielded a 29% response rate.  <br>Also, there was only a slight mentioning of the resident survey results in the report which <br>could have provided more insight about the success of program implementation. </span></nobr></DIV>

The overall <br>evaluation question was this: how does the work of the CPC impact the Neighborhood <br>Associations (NAs) of Trumbull and La Mesa? This question is specified further by <br>asking whether or not court monitoring, performed by members of the NAs in <br>coordination with the CPC, increases the likelihood that Weed and Seed drug trafficking <br>cases will be successfully prosecuted? <br> <br>The core objectives for the evaluation design were to: (1) thoroughly examine the <br>coordination efforts between the CPC and the Trumbull and La Mesa NAs and; (2) <br>determine whether court monitoring by neighborhood members is associated with <br>favorable prosecution outcomes for convicted criminals, especially drug-related offenses. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>It is clear by the data collected that neighborhood participation in the court monitoring <br>process has a positive effect on keeping criminals out of these neighborhoods.  There are <br>a greater number of stay away orders, less dismissals, and more prison sentences for <br>offenders arrested in the Weed and Seed sites, compared to other neighborhoods in <br>Albuquerque. In addition, neighborhood participation in the court monitoring process is <br>ostensibly facilitated by the CPC.  Through the coordination efforts of the NA members <br>and the CPC, drug trafficking cases are efficiently tracked as they are processed through <br>the system. Because of this, NA members are more effective in organizing their efforts in <br>keeping drug traffickers out of their neighborhoods.  Clearer, more formal collaborative <br>partnerships will promote further change and are the next step in providing these and <br>other Albuquerque neighborhoods with better, more comprehensive community services. </span></nobr></DIV>

The major goals related to the 4 components of weed and <br>seed programming; law enforcement, community policing, prevention, intervention, and <br>treatment and neighborhood restoration.  Crime rates, housing records, and information <br>from youth programs was collected and compared to baseline data from the previous two <br>years of the program.  Mail surveys of community residents and businesses were <br>conducted and their results were compared to survey results from the previous two years. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>Multiple findings were revealed in regards to the four components of weed and seed <br>programming.

The <br>community survey revealed that 34.3% of respondents stated that the law enforcement <br>component was average while 28.8% rated it as good.  According to the business survey, <br>nearly six in ten business owners have seen an increase in the visible prescense of police.  <br>In regards to community policing, ten block watches were found to be still active in the <br>community and there have been several training sesssions on crime prevention and <br>intervention being held for block watch members in year three.

This is a joint project of the Oklahoma City Police <br>Department (OCPD), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the <br>Oklahoma County District Attorney's Office, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the <br>Western District of Oklahoma. Project Exile began in February 2000 in response to <br>firearm violence, but additionally because of current state sentencing practices, which do <br>not require all firearm offenders to serve 85 percent of their sentence. The objective is to <br>reduce firearm violence in the Oklahoma City area through coordinated and targeted use <br>of federal, state and local law enforcement resources. <br> <br>The purpose of this report is to establish several baselines regarding the firearm offenders <br>and offenses for 1999 and to then compare them to those for 2000. Additionally, this <br>information is then to be compared to the Oklahoma City Weed and Seed location, as <br>well as a control area. More specifically, the goals and information included throughout <br>the report involve the following: <br> <br>- illustrating where the firearm offenses are occurring; <br>- providing/establishing a baseline on the number of offenses and where they are <br>occurring so they can be tracked (movement and displacement could be measured) and <br>identify trends which can be measured over time; <br>- providing detailed comprehensive information about the nature of these firearm <br>offenses; <br>- producing in-depth descriptive information about the firearm offenders; <br>- documenting the changing nature of the firearm offenders; and <br>- identify changes in firearm offenses and offenders between 1999 and 2000 in the whole <br>city-area, the Weed and Seed area, and the control area. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>The findings from this report include, although not exclusively, the following: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:155px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft4"> <br><b>Title:</b> Final Evaluation Report for the Philadelphia Weed and Seed Project <br> <br><b>Target Areas:</b> Philadelphia target area <br> <br><b>Number of Sites:</b> 1 <br> <br><b>Publication Date:</b> 12/10/1997 <br> <br><b>Focus: <br></b> <br>The Center for Social Policy and Community Development, Temple University, has <br>conducted an overall, outcome evaluation of Philadelphia's Weed and Seed Project, <br>covering the five years of the program's existence. The evaluation has had two primary <br>goals. <br> <br>1. To assess the extent to which the City of Philadelphia Weed and Seed Project has <br>accomplished its stated tasks and performed its stated activities. <br>2. To document and analyze the success, or lack thereof, of the Weed and Seed strategy, <br>as it has been applied in the City of Philadelphia. <br> <br>The evaluation included an emphasis on the impact that the project has had at the <br>neighborhood level and an emphasis on the lessons that can be learned from the <br>Philadelphia experience. A central aspect of the Weed and Seed strategy is the <br>collaboration between law enforcement agencies, between government agencies, and <br>between government agencies, community groups and the private sector. The shape and <br>outcomes of these collaborations was, therefore,  highlighted in the evaluation. <br> <br>The relative effectiveness of the various program elements and the way in which they <br>complement each other was assessed <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>Overall, the project has achieved successes far in excess of what should be expected, <br>given the level of funding available. Participants have accomplished their stated tasks in a <br>responsible and praiseworthy fashion. The community survey conducted for this <br>evaluation identified three needs as primary: eliminate the drug problem, provide youth <br>programming and/or recreational facilities and remove or renovate abandoned buildings. <br>The project has focused precisely upon these stated needs and has achieved considerable <br>success in each area. Over the five years of the project period there has been a decline in <br>the participation of a number of organizations, paralleling a decline in funds, and also a <br>turn away from a full-blown community policing strategy. Nevertheless, the experiences <br>that have been amassed indicate that the Weed and Seed strategy is well worth pursuing. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft4">It is concluded that the Philadelphia Weed and Seed project remains a very viable <br>experiment. If project participants agree to revisit the initial territorial approach --with its <br>close links between law enforcement and community groups -- and renew their efforts to <br>coordinate all relevant agencies, the project should be considered for further and greatly <br>increased funding. <br> <br>The participants of this project are committed and highly capable. The strategy continues <br>to hold promise for the resolution of a major social problem. Continued financial support <br>for this important effort is recommended. </span></nobr></DIV>

Especially worth noting is that <br>the Mayor and the Police Department responded to initial community concerns about the <br>potential negative aspects of the planned &quot;weeding&quot; activities.

These are target crimes for Weed and Seed and important quality of life <br>issues for distressed neighborhoods. Counts for these serious crimes are down in the <br>Weed and Seed sites. However, these crimes are also lower in the city as a whole. <br> <br>A further examination of the same types of crime data answers the question whether the <br>general reduction in reported crime is expected or real by measuring the relative <br>percentage of crime in Seattle's Weed and Seed sites. This indicated that the Central <br>Weed and Seed site accounted disproportionately for about 17 percent of Seattle's serious <br>crime in 1994, but that in 2000 the area only accounted for about 12 percent of Seattle's <br>serious crime. Crime not only went down in the Central District; it went down faster than <br>the remainder of the city. This was not expected and is probably not explicable without <br>the intervention of Weed and Seed law enforcement and community programs. <br> <br>The Southeast Weed and Seed site, in the South Precinct showed an initial proportional <br>improvement between 1997 and 1998 by dropping from about 12 to 10 percent of <br>Seattle's crime. Since then it has made no more progress than the remainder of the city. <br>But like the rise and then decline of proportional levels of crime in 1998 in the Central <br>District, things can improve after a setback. Weed and Seed is not a stagnate strategy. <br>When things start to slip, Weed and Seed police, planners, and community activists <br>recognize changes in crimes, adjust, and readdress the situation The small increase in <br>crime in 2000 in the Southeast Weed and Seed site, which the SPD reports is in part due <br>to displacement of crime from the Central District, is being met through the initiation of <br>new law enforcement and community organization initiatives. <br> <br>A number of positive outcomes were reported for various seed activities and leveraging <br>of outside resources to support the Site's efforts. </span></nobr></DIV>

Study methodology <br>consisted of gathering data from newspapers and related weed and seed activity reports, <br>conducting interviews with steering committee members and law enforcement  as well as <br>community policing officers, data analysis of police crime reports, a focus group <br>interview with safe haven representatives, and a community impact survey. <br> <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br> <br>Results revealed multiple findings from the four targets areas of weed and seed <br>programming.  Law enforcement was found to be the most important component of the <br>program with the most focus and money used.  There was a 28% reduction in crime in <br>East Wheeling compared to only a decrease of 4% for the entire city of Wheeling.  <br>Steering committee interviews revelaed an overall consesnus that the weeding aspect of <br>the program had been successful.  The community impact survey showed that East <br>Wheeling  residents were pleased with police efforts.  In regards to community policing, <br>it was found that there has been an increase in confidence by site residents towards the <br>police and trust between them as well.  A seeding impact was seen as moderate to low.  <br>However, through multiple seeding programs, children were seen as a priority by East <br>Wheeling Weed and Seed.  Neighborhood revitalization was seen as not meeting goals as <br>almost half of site residents believed that neigborhood condtions are worse or at least still <br>problematic.  Recommendations were given that supported a more cohesive steering <br>committee, only one recognized safe haven, caution when choosing the site fiscal <br>manager, and a separate entity to support neighborhood revitalization. <br> <br>There are a few notable problems with this study.  First, in one part of the results, crime <br>data and community impact survey results in East Wheeling were compared to Wheeling <br>Island even though these two communites are dissimilar in regards to race and median <br>income.  Thus, a comparison here must be taken with caution.  Next, the reduction in <br>crime noted in East Wheeling must be taken with caution as well as there was an increase </span></nobr></DIV>

A determination of a demographic profile of children who attended the Safe Haven <br>programs. Children who attended the programs were contrasted with (a) all other children <br>in their schools and (b) other children who resided in the target neighborhoods but did not <br>participate in the programs. The purpose of these comparisons was to ascertain if the Safe <br>Haven programs were successful in identifying and serving children who were at risk for <br>academic and social problems. <br> <br>2. A limited examination of children's Safe Haven experiences. This included ratings of <br>the quality of the programs, a determination of how often the children actually attended <br>the programs, and how the children perceived the programs. <br> <br>3. Tests of program effects on children's development. Five aspects of child adjustment <br>were investigated: academic grades, conduct grades, school absences, misconduct, and <br>conflict resolution strategies. We sought to determine if program attendance was <br>associated with these adjustment indices. We examined this issue across one-year and <br>two-year time periods. <br> <br> <br><b>Findings: <br></b> <br>There were positive effects of participation in the Safe Haven programs on children's <br>school attendance, conduct, and conflict resolution strategies. One-year comparisons <br>between adjustment in May 1996 and in May 1997 revealed that children who <br>participated in the programs during the 1996-97 school year improved their attendance at <br>school and engaged in less misconduct compared to children who did not attend the <br>programs. Improvements in conflict resolution strategies also were found for Safe Haven <br>participants. Children who were enrolled in the programs increased their endorsement of <br>an avoidance strategy for dealing with peer conflicts. <br> </span></nobr></DIV>

Program children also evaluated an avoidance <br>strategy for dealing with peer conflicts more positively than non-program children did <br>following their participation in the programs. </span></nobr></DIV>

The Milwaukee Weed and Seed Program has been a major <br>contributing factor in the overall reduction of crime in the targeted areas - especially <br>violent crime and drug and weapons offenses. Inasmuch as the decline was greater in the <br>Weed and Seed target areas than the comparison areas, this would indicate that the Weed <br>and Seed Program has been successful in its crime reduction strategy. The greatest <br>reduction in the level of criminal activity occurred in the Avenues West target area, <br>whereas the least improvement took place in Metcalfe Park. <br> <br>- Residents feel safer. In all three Weed and Seed target areas, residents perceive that <br>their neighborhoods are safer since the start of the Weed and Seed Program in 1995. In <br>the two and a half years since Weed and Seed began in Milwaukee, the level of fear <br>expressed by target area residents has fallen significantly as has the percentage of <br>residents reporting criminal victimization to the survey team. <br> <br>- Residents' attitudes toward police performance are more positive. A growing number of <br>people living in the target areas are finding favor with how Milwaukee police perform <br>their job. The opinions and attitudes of residents about police performance have grown <br>more positive in the last several years, especially regarding quality of life/community <br>policing activities. The commitment demonstrated by the Milwaukee Police Department <br>in using Weed and Seed funds to target drug houses and open air drug markets as well as <br>an array of nuisance ordinance violations has received strong support in all three areas. <br> <br>- Weed and seed arrests remove a significant percentage of serious offenders. One in four <br>Weed and Seed arrests in 1995 and 1996 resulted in individuals being removed from the <br>community and placed via the courts in state prisons or state run, secure and/or juvenile <br>institutions. An additional twenty percent were removed and committed to the Milwaukee <br>County House of Correction. <br> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109px;left:135px"><nobr><span class="ft4">- Weed and Seed enhanced agency cooperation; the Milwaukee Police Department and <br>the State Department of Corrections have utilized the opportunity provided by the Weed <br>and Seed Program to work closely together, share information on probationers and <br>parolees, and enhance the overall safety of the target areas. The Milwaukee Police and <br>Federal law enforcement agencies have implemented successful initiatives targeting drug <br>dealers. <br> <br>- A key feature and innovative aspect of the seeding portion of Milwaukee's Weed and <br>Seed Program has been the work of project staff known as Community Liaisons. The <br>work of three Community liaisons is having a positive impact on the three targeted areas <br>that they serve. Their door-to-door communication efforts and their efforts to build <br>neighborhood strategies have gained community approval and support for this approach <br>to strengthening neighborhood resistance to crime. Milwaukee's innovative Weed and <br>Seed Community Liaisons provide a key communication link to and from residents. <br> <br>The Milwaukee Weed and Seed Program has demonstrated the value of its strategy of <br>&quot;weeding out&quot; violent crime and gang activity and improving the quality of life in the <br>targeted areas. Challenges remain, however, and crime is still a problem in the target <br>neighborhoods. The groundwork for continuing the Weed and Seed Program has been <br>completed, and plans for a sustained source of funding need to be pursued. Finally, given <br>the diverse nature of the Weed and Seed target areas, the Milwaukee Weed and Seed <br>approach is replicable and provides a model for developing an anti-crime strategy in <br>other areas of Milwaukee.</span></nobr></DIV>

One year later it <br>was reduced to about 450. Each of the three neighborhoods realized a substantial <br>decrease in violent crime. <br> <br>Compared to Surrounding Neighborhoods -- Crime Was Lower Than Expected -  The <br>evaluation shows that arrests for violent, weapon, drugs and violation of probation in <br>surrounding comparison group neighborhoods increase slightly, while at the same time <br>the number of arrests for the same crimes decreased in the Weed and Seed neighborhoods <br>by about 21 percent.  While there is still a lot of crime in the Weed and Seed <br>neighborhoods, the greatest success has been a reduction in the most serious and <br>dangerous crimes. <br> <br>Residents Feel Safer - Based on randomly selected respondents, neighborhood residents <br>were favorably affected by the impact of the Milwaukee Weed and Seed programs. <br>Before Weed and Seed between 50 and 65 percent of the residents feared that they would <br>be a victim of a serious crime. In 1996, although still high, this &quot;fear rate&quot; had decreased <br>to about 45 percent for neighborhood residents. <br> <br>Attitudes of the Police Starts to Become More Positive - The surveys also indicated that <br>residents were significantly more aware of increased police presence. The: pre - post <br>surveys also show a 10 to 20 percentage point increase - now over half - of the residents <br>feel that &quot;the police department has done a good job in making me feel safe in this area.&quot; <br>Likewise, survey results show a very favorable response to the work of the community <br>liaisons. Most residents were impressed with the helpfulness and knowledge of the &quot;new&quot; <br>community workers. Still residents want more police protection. </span></nobr></DIV>
